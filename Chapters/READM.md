Condensed Matter Physics Group Thesis LaTeX Template
====================================================

This directory contains the main content of your thesis. Create a separate Chapter_# where # is the chapter number for each chapter in your thesis.
Inside each Chapter folder, create a Chaoter_#_Fig directory to keep your figure files in and also create a Chapter_#_File.tex file for the text. You can
see the correct layout in the Chapter_1 folder in this template.

Then you will need to include the new chapter in the TempleThesis_Clean.tex file in the main directory. You will need to edit in two places:

-.	the \graphicspath around line 7
-.	add an additional \include line around line 94

This directory does not contain the Appendices or front-matter of your thesis. Those live in separate sub-directories from the main template.
